# BBS Reference Implementation

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

TypeScript reference implementation for the [BBS signature scheme](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/bbs-signature). The goal is to help understand and verify the specification. This is NOT a production-ready implementation; testing is minimal and no effort is made to optimize and protect against specialized attacks (e.g., side-channel resistance). 

This project aims to keep up to date with the [latest specification](https://identity.foundation/bbs-signature/draft-looker-cfrg-bbs-signatures.html), but may be behind since the specification changes often; the current implementation matches the *11 March 2023* version of the specification, matching the [draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-02](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures/02/) version submitted to the CFRG.

Given the rapid evolution of the BBS scheme, there might be inconsistencies between the specification and the code; please open issues or file PRs if you find any!

## Known issues

This library is a work in progress. Here are some known issues:
* Only the BLS12-381-SHA-256 ciphersuite is currently available

## Setup

Make sure [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) are installed on your system; the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version is recommended for both.

1. Get the source, for example using `git`
```
git clone -b main https://github.com/microsoft/bbs-node-reference.git
cd bbs-node-reference
```

2. Build the `npm` package
```
npm install
npm run build
```

3. Optionally, run the unit tests

```
npm test
```

4. Optionally, run the sample program

```
npm run bbs
```
